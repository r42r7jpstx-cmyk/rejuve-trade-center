<!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
<section class="section" id="philosophy">
  <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    We believe medical and aesthetic devices must be safe, compliant, and aligned
    with real clinical needs. As an importer, our responsibility extends beyond
    logistics — it includes regulatory coordination, documentation integrity, and
    responsible market entry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Market demand increasingly favors minimally invasive, non-invasive, efficient,
    and portable technologies. We align our sourcing strategy with these trends
    while maintaining strict compliance with US regulatory standards.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- COMPLIANCE -->
<section class="section gray" id="compliance">
  <h2>Compliance & Regulatory Standards</h2>
  <div class="split">
    <img src="compliance.jpg">
    <p>
      Compliance is central to Rejuve Trade Center’s operations. We work closely
      with manufacturing partners to ensure imported devices meet FDA requirements
      and applicable US regulations. Our processes emphasize traceability, risk
      awareness, and long-term regulatory alignment.
    </p>
