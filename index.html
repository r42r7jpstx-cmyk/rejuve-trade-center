<!-- Philosophy -->
<section class="section" id="philosophy">
  <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    We believe that medical and aesthetic technologies must be safe, compliant, and
    purpose-driven. Our role as an importer is not only to move products across
    borders, but to ensure that every device entering the market meets regulatory
    standards and real clinical needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rejuve Trade Center prioritizes long-term partnerships over short-term volume.
    We focus on responsible sourcing, clear documentation, and sustainable business
    practices that support both suppliers and healthcare providers.

    <p>
      Compliance is central to our operations. We coordinate closely with
      manufacturers to ensure all imported devices align with FDA requirements and
      applicable US regulations. Our quality approach emphasizes documentation,
      traceability, and ongoing regulatory awareness.
